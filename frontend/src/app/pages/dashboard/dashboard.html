    <h2>Project overview</h2>
    <p>
      Researchers in UNC Charlotte’s Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering are training
      advanced artificial intelligence models to spot eye disease years before symptoms appear. Led
      by Dr. Minhaj Alam, the team is using deep learning to analyze high-resolution retina scans
      and detect microscopic changes associated with conditions such as diabetic retinopathy and
      macular degeneration. These diseases often progress silently, meaning patients typically do
      not seek treatment until their vision has already begun to deteriorate. Traditional screenings
      rely on busy specialists manually reviewing thousands of images, a process that can be slow,
      inconsistent, and difficult to scale. The new AI-driven system instead learns from large
      datasets of expertly labeled scans and identifies subtle patterns of damage long before a
      patient notices any change in sight. By highlighting potential risk early, the technology
      could make screenings more accessible, reduce specialist workload, and enable earlier
      intervention that preserves long-term vision. In both classroom projects and laboratory
      research, UNC Charlotte students directly contribute to developing, training, and evaluating
      these models, giving them hands-on experience with tools used in real clinical and
      public-health environments. The work has already drawn media attention in Charlotte and
      demonstrates how the university pairs cutting-edge research with meaningful student
      involvement to address urgent healthcare challenges.

    <h2>How A02 is built</h2>
    <p>
      A02 is a single-page web application built with an Angular frontend and a Node.js / Express
      backend connected to MongoDB Atlas. The frontend runs on port 80 behind NGINX, which also
      reverse-proxies API requests to the backend running on port 3000. Authentication uses JSON Web
      Tokens (JWT): the backend issues a signed token when the user logs in with the assignment
      credentials, and Angular attaches the token to authorized HTTP requests. Chart data for the
      Summary and Reports pages is delivered as JSON from two backend endpoints tied to the same
      article, and the SPA uses the Angular router with guards to keep all protected pages behind
      login.
