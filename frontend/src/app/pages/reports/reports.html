        This chart estimates how many cases of preventable vision impairment could be avoided over a
        five-year period with the adoption of AI-supported retina screening compared to traditional
        screening workflows. Because the model can detect abnormalities earlier and more
        consistently, patients who might otherwise progress unnoticed can receive timely treatment.
        The upward trend reflects the cumulative effect of earlier intervention and increased
        screening capacity made possible by automated image analysis. While the numbers are
        hypothetical, they are consistent with the types of public-health impacts discussed in the
        UNC Charlotte AI screening research, showing how advanced diagnostic tools can strengthen
        long-term outcomes for at-risk populations.
