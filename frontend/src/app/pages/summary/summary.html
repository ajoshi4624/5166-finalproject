        This chart illustrates how an AI model trained on retina scans categorizes patients into
        low, medium, and high-risk groups based on early indicators of vision-threatening disease.
        Rather than relying solely on manual image review, the model evaluates subtle patterns that
        may reflect emerging damage long before symptoms appear. The distribution shown here
        demonstrates the system’s ability to flag higher-risk cases for closer clinical attention
        while efficiently processing a large number of low-risk scans. These values are simulated
        for the purposes of this project but are based on trends described in UNC Charlotte research
        exploring AI-assisted early detection for retinal disease.
